                <div class="text-xl font-medium" id="draft">3. Draft</div> 
                <div class="pl-4">3.1. The league draft will be a live draft, held as close to the beginning of the NHL season as possible.</div> 
                <div class="pl-4">3.2. If an owner is unable to attend the daft, they will be able to make their picks online via the draft board chat window.</div> <div class="pl-4">3.3. Draft order will be determined as reverse order of the final standings (excluding consolation bracket games).</div> 
                <div class="pl-4">3.4. All non-playoff teams will be entered into a weighted draft lottery for the 1st overall pick. This will only apply for the 1st round of the draft.</div>

            <div>
                <div class="text-xl font-medium" id="roster">4. Roster</div> 
                <div class="pl-4">4.1. Each roster will consist of 20 players.</div> 
                <div class="pl-4">4.2. Roster positions are as follows: 2C, 2LW, 2RW, 2F, 4D, 2G, 6 Bench, 1 IR, 3 IR+</div>

                <div class="text-xl font-medium" id="keepers">5. Keepers</div> 
                <div class="pl-4">5.1. Teams can keep up to 12 players.</div> 
                <div class="pl-4">5.2. A player's keeper value is the round they were drafted in, minus two. For example, Patrick Laine was drafted in the 9th round of the 2016-2017 draft. In order to keep Laine the manager must give up a 7th round pick in the 2017-2018 draft.</div> 
                <div class="pl-4">5.3. An player that is not drafted can be kept for the cost of a 14th round pick.</div> 
                <div class="pl-4">5.4. A player's keeper value cannot change mid-season, it is only set and reset at the draft. For example, Jordan Eberle was drafted in the 8th round of the 2016-2017 draft and dropped mid-season. He was picked up, but still costs a 6th round pick in the 2017-2018 draft if an owner wants to keep him.</div> 
                <div class="pl-4">5.5. If an owner does not have the required pick to keep a player, they may substitute an earlier round pick. For example, Mike Hoffman was picked up during the 2015-2016 season so his cost was a 14th round pick. If the owner's next available pick was their 12th round pick so Mike Hoffman would have to be kept for a 12th round cost.</div> 
                <div class="pl-4">5.6. Keeper lists must be set on Yahoo, or sent to the commissioner by the keeper deadline. The deadline will be one week before the draft.</div> 
                <div class="pl-4">5.7. The commissioner will provide each manager with a list of keeper costs for each team, as well as their draft picks in the upcoming draft.</div>
